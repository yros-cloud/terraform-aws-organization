## üì¶ Usage

```hcl
module "organization" {
    
  source = "yros-cloud/organization/aws"
  
  # Uncomment and set this if you already have an AWS Organization
  # existing_organization_id = "r-xxxx"

  # You can add more OUs here, such as "security", "networking", "platform", etc.
  organizational_units = {
    workloads      = "Workloads"
    infrastructure = "Infrastructure"
    # security     = "Security"
    # networking   = "Networking"
    # platform     = "Platform"
  }

  accounts = {
    development = {
      email      = "youremailgroup+awsdev@example.com"
      name       = "Development"
      parent_key = "workloads"
    }

    staging = {
      email      = "youremailgroup+awsstaging@example.com"
      name       = "Staging"

    "sso.amazonaws.com",
    "health.amazonaws.com"

## üßê Notes

* If `existing_organization_id` is set, the module uses that organization and **skips creating the root account**.
* Accounts are only created if their `parent_key` matches a valid OU or `"root"`.
